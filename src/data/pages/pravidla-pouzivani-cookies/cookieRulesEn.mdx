### **6. How to Adjust Cookie Settings?**
Due to changes in legal regulations, websites can no longer use cookies without your active consent, as the principle has shifted from opt-out (where consent was assumed and could be revoked) to opt-in (you need to actively give your consent). This does not apply to essential cookies, which still operate on an opt-out basis, and you can revoke consent in your browser settings. 

As mentioned in Article 2, consent is granted for 6 months, after which the website will prompt you again to grant or revoke consent.

A "cookie banner" has been added to obtain consent for using cookies. This banner is divided into two layers. The first layer allows you to give consent to all types of cookies, decline consent to cookies requiring opt-in, close the cookie banner, or click "Settings" to access the second layer. In the second layer, you can selectively consent to specific types of cookies.

You can change your decision at any time during your use of the website by clicking the field in the website footer to trigger the cookie banner again and decide which types of cookies to accept or reject. This consent/rejection will be valid for 6 months from the last change.

We would like to remind you that refusing consent to certain types of cookies may degrade the user experience and limit access to services provided by our website, especially those related to the specific types of cookies described in Article 3.

If you block cookies in your browser, we will not process your network identifiers or other information that can be obtained via cookies.
