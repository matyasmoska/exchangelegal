## **What is the investment questionnaire for suitability assessment?**
 
The investment questionnaire for suitability assessment is used so that the manager, in accordance with § 15 of the Investment Funds Act (ZISIF), can obtain detailed information about the investor's knowledge and experience, financial background, and investment goals – in other words, to create their investment profile. Based on this information, the manager can competently assess whether the offered service or strategy is suitable and meets the investor's expertise and needs.

Filling out the questionnaire is crucial to ensure that the services provided align with the investor’s requirements and best interests, particularly in terms of understanding related risks. Information obtained through the questionnaire is protected by data protection laws and is subject to confidentiality.

If the investor does not provide truthful or complete answers, there may be an incorrect assessment of their needs, leading to recommendations of an unsuitable investment strategy. Refusing to complete the questionnaire may also mean that the manager will not be able to take over the investment for management.

The goal of the questionnaire is therefore to ensure that investments correspond to the investor's abilities, knowledge, and expectations, and to minimize the risk of inappropriate decisions.
