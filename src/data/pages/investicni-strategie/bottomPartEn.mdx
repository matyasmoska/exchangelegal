## **What is an investment strategy?**

Each fund must have a clearly defined **investment strategy** for managing entrusted assets. The investment strategy must be predetermined, specific, and binding for the fund manager, who is obligated to manage the fund's assets in accordance with it. It’s important to understand that investment activity is a service provided to investors who contribute their assets to the fund.

The manager carries out this activity based on the investment strategy.

## **What does the investment strategy include?**

According to the law, an investment strategy refers to the method of investing by an alternative investment fund.

**The investment strategy should include in particular:**

- **types of assets** that may be acquired into the fund’s property – e.g. types of securities or types of bonds;
- **investment limits** that must be observed in relation to the above-mentioned assets;
- information on whether the fund **tracks or replicates an index**, and its description; 
- details of a particular **economic sector, area, or market segment** in which the fund concentrates its investments;
- **possibilities and limits of hedging** or guarantees and the manner of their application;
- information on the **techniques used for managing the fund** and the possibilities and limits of their use;
- rules for the **use of leverage**;
