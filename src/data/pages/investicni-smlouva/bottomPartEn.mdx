## **What is an investment agreement?**

An investment agreement is a key component of the "mandatory toolkit" for any alternative investment fund. It is a contract with the client that includes, among other things, the investment strategy or an extract thereof. Typically, it is a template document that is presented to prospective investors in your fund and subsequently entered into with the investor/client.

## **What does the investment agreement include?**

In addition to standard contractual provisions (such as subject of the agreement, duration of the relationship, means of communication, etc.), the investment agreement must clearly **define the investment the client is contributing to the fund.** The agreement also sets out how the investment will be managed, often by referencing the fund’s investment strategy. A crucial part is the method for returning the investment. The agreement also governs the distribution of profits from the fund’s activities, or at least defines how the return is calculated. 

We also recommend including a statement that the fund’s activity **is not subject to supervision by the Czech National Bank,** and additional provisions related to AML/CFT obligations, etc.
