## **Alternative Investment Fund under § 15 ZISIF** (so-called "venture capital person")

An Alternative Investment Fund (also known as a minifund, etc. – see below) is defined by the provisions of § 15 of Act No. 240/2013 Coll., on Investment Companies and Investment Funds, as amended.

A so-called alternative fund, minifund, or alternative investment fund is a vehicle and at the same time a simple way of managing investors’ assets which, compared to classic investment funds, **is not subject to regulation and supervision by the Czech National Bank (ČNB)** as other investment funds are, and is only registered with the ČNB.

Compared to classic investment funds, an alternative investment fund (minifund) is characterized by **low administrative requirements, simplicity of establishment, and speed in the registration process with the ČNB**.


## **Alternative Fund, 15 ZISIF or ZISIF 15, Minifund, Alternative Investment Fund, or Quasi-Fund?**

The designations "15 ZISIF," "ZISIF 15," "patnáctkář," "15ka," "minifund," "alternative investment fund," "alternative fund," or "fund under § 15 ZISIF" are identical in content; in all cases, they refer to a vehicle under § 15 of the Act on Investment Companies and Investment Funds, i.e. **it is asset management comparable to administration**.

Sometimes in the Czech environment, one may also come across the terms **"pseudofund"** or **"quasi-fund"**; in all cases, these always refer to companies that carry out asset management comparable to administration under § 15(1) of Act No. 240/2013 Coll., on Investment Companies and Investment Funds.

From 1st of July 2024, the fund manager must include "venture capital person" in its name.
